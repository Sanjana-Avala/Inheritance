# PRIMM: Inheritance

In this PRIMM activity, you will learn about inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming by implementing a Zoo of Animals.

## Predict
Without running the program, examine the UML files in resources, and the program code. Answer the following questions.
1. What does the code output?
    > Your answer
2. What is the connection between the Animal class and the Lion class?
    > Your answer
3. What does the keyword `extends` means?
    > Your answer

## Run
Run the code.
1. What was the output?
    > Your answer

2. How did the output differ from your predictions.
    > Your answer

## Investigate
View the instructor's slides on inheritance and polymorphism.

## Modify
Review the UML diagrams in the `resources` folder.
1. Implement the `Animal` class.
2. Implement the `Lion` class.
3. In the `InheritanceZoo` create a `Lion` object and call the `Lion` specific methods.

## Make
1. Create at least five (5) different `Animal` subclasses
2. Add them to the `InheritanceZoo` (the ArrayList of animals).
3. Iterate through the `InheritanceZoo` and call methods from the super class `Animal`.
